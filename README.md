# Departments Menu for Business Central

*Note: This app is mainly for training purposes, covering many aspects and technics of AL development.*

Departments menu was a feature of Windows Client (RTC) that is unavailable on the Web Client, now Modern Client. This app's aim is to replicate a similar functionality using AL and JavaScript components.
